âœ… I created a new folder with the token address (all in lowercase for EVM chains, case sensitive for Solana)
I added the token's logo as a 32x32 PNG file, named logo-32.png
I added the token's logo as a 128x128 PNG file, named logo-128.png
I added the token's logo as a SVG file, named logo.svg
âœ… My SVG logo is a proper SVG and does not contain base64 encoded elements
âœ… My documentation/website clearly display the token address
